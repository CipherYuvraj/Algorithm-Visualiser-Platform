## ⚖️ Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. 📝 Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community, such as dismissive comments about someone's algorithmic approach.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. ⚠️ Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions, such as repeatedly interrupting educational discussions or making condescending remarks about coding abilities.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. ⏰ Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior that disrupts the learning environment.
